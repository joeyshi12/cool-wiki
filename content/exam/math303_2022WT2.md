## Question 1

Consider a Markov chain with states $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$ and transition probabilities
$p_{ii} = p_{i,i+1}$ for all states $i$ and $p_{i0} = \frac{1}{3}$ for $i > 0$.

(a) Is the chain irreducible? No justification needed.

(b) What is the period of the chain? Prove your answer.

(c) Is the chain recurrent? Prove your answer.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
(a) Yes

(b) 1 since $p_{00} > 0$

(c) Yes. We can show $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} p_{00}^{(n)} = \infty$.
